By dedicating 2 SDRs to inbound phone and chat, we hypothesize that our MQL-to-Opp conversions rates will improve due to these factors:
   1. Less context switching will allow SDR’s to remain in flow for more of their day.  As a result, we expect the 2 dedicated SDRs to follow-up on 25% more MQLs and the other SDRs to follow-up on 10.5% more MQLs.
  2. This will allow the 2 dedicated SDR to respond to 10% more live chats and 20% more talkdesk calls (rather than going to voicemail or dropping off), resulting in a 10% increase in MQL-to-Opp conversions.
  3. This will also allow the non-dedicated SDRs to follow-up on a higher portion of MQLs faster, therefore improving their MQL-to-Opp conversion rates by 10%.
As a net result of all of this, our overall MQL-to-Opp conversion will increase from our historical 26.83% (based on the last 3 months) to 36.8%.

Hypothesis 1 and 2 and 3

Hypothesis 1 (Drift): 
By having dedicated reps engage in Drift conversations earlier we will decrease the number of “bot only” responses, resulting in a higher Chat to Lead conversion rate.   
Time frame: Nov 1 - Dec 31
Baseline comparison August - October (By rep) 

Hypothesis 2 (Talk Desk): 
Implementing a Shift model with Talk desk should increase the First attempt to connect metric 
Time frame: Nov 1 - Dec 31
Baseline comparison August - October (By rep) 

Hypothesis 3 (MQL): 
Specialization of SDR inputs will lead to more opps converted and a higher conversion rate.
Increase total Opps converted
Increase conversion rate MQL to Opp
Time frame: Nov 1 - Dec 31
Baseline comparison August - October (By rep)
