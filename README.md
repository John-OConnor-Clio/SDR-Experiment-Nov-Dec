Hypothesis 1 and 2 and 3

Hypothesis 1 (Drift): 
By having dedicated reps engage in Drift conversations earlier we will decrease the number of “bot only” responses, resulting in a higher Chat to Lead conversion rate.   
Time frame: Nov 1 - Dec 31
Baseline comparison August - October (By rep) 

Hypothesis 2 (Talk Desk): 
Implementing a Shift model with Talk desk should increase the First attempt to connect metric 
Time frame: Nov 1 - Dec 31
Baseline comparison August - October (By rep) 

Hypothesis 3 (MQL): 
Specialization of SDR inputs will lead to more opps converted and a higher conversion rate.
Increase total Opps converted
Increase conversion rate MQL to Opp
Time frame: Nov 1 - Dec 31
Baseline comparison August - October (By rep)
